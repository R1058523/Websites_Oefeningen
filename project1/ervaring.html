          <h1>Experience</h1>
          <p>Throughout my career, I’ve gained valuable and diverse experience, primarily within the food service industry,
              with a growing focus on transitioning into the tech field. My journey began with my education in multimedia,
              where I gained foundational experience in graphic design tools like Photoshop and Illustrator, as well as
              photography. This gave me the ability to handle creative projects, such as designing my own logos and creating
              visual content, skills that I still use today.</p>
          <p>After my studies, I worked as a baker in my family’s bakery, which allowed me to develop a strong work ethic,
              attention to detail, and the ability to manage time effectively in a fast-paced environment. Unfortunately, due
              to the COVID-19 pandemic, the bakery had to close, and I transitioned to a managerial role at Domino's Pizza. As
              a manager, I was responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations, managing a team, ensuring customer
              satisfaction, and optimizing processes to ensure smooth service. In this role, I honed my leadership, team
              management, and problem-solving skills, while ensuring the business ran efficiently under pressure.</p>
          <p>Although my professional experience has been largely in the food service industry, my true passion lies in
              technology, specifically in programming. I am now dedicating my time and energy to learning and growing in the
              IT sector. While I’m still new to programming, my past experiences have provided me with valuable transferable
              skills, such as perseverance, problem-solving, and the ability to adapt to challenging environments.</p>
          <p>My background in multimedia and design also allows me to bring a creative edge to my technical work, and I am
              excited to merge these two fields as I progress in my programming career. With my mix of hands-on experience,
              creative skills, and a growing knowledge of IT, I’m eager to contribute and develop further in the tech
              industry.</p>
