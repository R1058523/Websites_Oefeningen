    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm Kilian, a 30-year-old with a unique
      background shaped by both hands-on craftsmanship and a growing passion for
      technology. I began my career working alongside my father in our
      family-owned bakery, where I focused on the craft of baking rather than
      managing the business. Unfortunately, the bakery had to close due to the
      impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led me to seek new opportunities. I
      transitioned to working as a manager at Domino's Pizza, where I gained
      valuable experience in team leadership and customer service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though my past has been rooted in food service, my true passion lies in
      the IT sector, particularly in programming. I'm new to the world of
      coding, and while I don't have much experience yet, I'm eager to learn and
      grow in this field. This website is a reflection of my journey as I step
      into the world of technology, and I’m excited to share my progress and
      future projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks for visiting, and feel free to follow along as I continue to build
      my skills and explore the endless possibilities in programming!
    </p>
